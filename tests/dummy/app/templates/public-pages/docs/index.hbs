<h1 class="doc-page-title">Overview</h1>


<p>I'm going to tell you the store of how this component was born.</p>

<p>
  I was building a select component but I realized that a select it's nothing else than a
  dropdown with some extra stuff on top. And a datepicker too. And colorpickers, contextual
  menus and many other widgets.
</p>

<p>
  Essentially, any floating box of content that is opened when you interact with a trigger
  is basically a dropdown. Dropdowns are the foundation to at least half a docen of common
  UI widgets we use often, so I decided to shape this addon in a way that was easy to reuse
  and customize to create those other widgets.
</p>

<p>
  But if a dropdown is just a floating box activated by a trigger, why would you want to
  use third part addon for such a simple thing?
</p>

<p>
  Well, there is two kind of persons. Those who think that dropdowns are an easy thing and
  those who have actually built one.
</p>

<p>
  While I transitioned from the first kind to the second I learned a lot of stuff.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absolutely position elements in a performant way</li>
  <li>Overcoming z-index limitations</li>
  <li>Use MutationObservers and DOM Events</li>
  <li>Proper detection of taps and touch scroll</li>
  <li>Animating elements being removed from the screen</li>
  <li>Chasing memory leaks when global events are not property removed</li>
  <li>Accessibility and keyboard navigation</li>
</ul>

<p>
  After I built the initial version, I started to build other things on top and I had to step
  back a few times and identify where it wasn't flexible enough, and this process ended up
  in a component that distilled the essence of what a dropdown is, with very few assumptions.
</p>

<p>
  I honestly want you to save you time and tears. I've been there.
</p>

<p>
  This component is a <strong>building block</strong> for you to build other components on top,
  so it prioritizes flexibility and explicitness over succinctness in it's API, but still
  allows allows basic usage out of the box with no ceremony.
</p>

<p>
  Another thing to note is that this component doesn't have any theme by default, so unless
  you do something about it, it will look ugly unless you style it. The few styles it has
  are only to deal with positioning.
</p>

<p>I hope you like it.</p>
